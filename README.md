# Overview

I am trying to become the best software engineer that I can be, and I can't do that by skipping ahead or going to fast. I become the best by mastering the basics in a new language for me! I learned C++, C#, Javascript, HTML, R, and a bit of SQL so far. I just learned Kotlin this semester and now I am learning Rust.

I made a simple calculator in Rust to learn about all the language's quirks.

It is similar to C++ and is supposed to help with object oriented methodologies, so I thought it would be a great language to add to my arsenal.

# Development Environment

I used Github, Replit, and Visual studios as I learned to write in Rust.

I used Rust as the programming language and Cargo as the as the build environment.

# Future Work

- Make the calculator more complex
- Maybe add Pemdas and see if you can nest equations
- Which means parenthesis and exponents need to be added first
